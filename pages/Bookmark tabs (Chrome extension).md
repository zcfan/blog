- This extension is inspired by Arc browser. I love the way how it integrates bookmarks and tabs together, but dislike almost all the other ideas. Especially those AI craps.
- So here comes the very early first version of "Bookmark tabs" extension.
- It's not just a vertical bookmark, when you click a bookmark, it associated with the opened tab, so you can switch the tab by click the bookmark again.
- It's simple but after a few days of daily usage by myself, I'll say it's comprehensive enough.
